# For Loops 📚

A ``for`` loop allows Python to keep repeating code a set number of times. It is sometimes known as a *"counting loop"* because you know the number of times the loop will run before it starts. 

``for`` loops are the preferred looping mechanism when the number of required iterations is 
known in advance (of runtime). Because of their nature they are also commonly used to 
traverse sequences (i.e. *"strings"* and *"lists"*).


## Example 1 🕵️‍♂️
The ``range`` function is often used in ``for`` loops and it lists the starting number, the ending number and can also include the counting steps *(e.g. counting in 1s, 2s, 5s or any other value you wish).*

✍ In your copy, predict what you think the following piece of code will do.

````py
for i in range (1, 10):
  print(i)

````
👉 Now type the code into `main.py` and test your prediction.


This loop uses a variable called `i` to keep track of the number of times the loop has been repeated.

It will start with `i = 1` *(this is the starting value in the range function.)* and repeat the loop, adding 1 to `i` each time and displaying the value of `i` until it reaches 10, where it will stop.

💡 Therefore it will not repeat the loop a tenth time and will have the following output.

  We can see that the output will be 

  ````
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9
  ````
When it gets to 10 the loop will stop, so 10 will not be shown in the output.
