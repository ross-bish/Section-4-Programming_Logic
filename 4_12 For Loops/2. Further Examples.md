# Further Examples - For loops

Again, as on the previous page, you are required to *"Predict"* what will happen in your copy before you code up the problem. 

Try not to look at the answer until after you have *"Predicted"* and *"Run"* the code yourself.

 
## Example 2 🕵️‍♂️

✍ In your copy, predict what you think the following piece of code will do.

````py
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
  print(i)

````

👉 Now type the code into `main.py` and test your prediction.

<details>
  <summary> 👀 Answer </summary>
  
This range function includes a third value which shows how much is added to `i` in each loop *(in this case 2).* 

So the output will be: 

  ````
  1,3,5,7,9
  ````

</details>

## Example 3 🕵️‍♂️

✍ In your copy, predict what you think the following piece of code will do.

````py
for i in range(10, 1, -3):
  print(i)

````

👉 Now type the code into `main.py` and test your prediction.

<details>
  <summary> 👀 Answer </summary>
  
This range will subtract 3 from `i` each time. 

So the output will be: 

  ````
  10, 7, 4
  ````

</details>


## Example 4 🕵️‍♂️
✍ In your copy, predict what you think the following piece of code will do.

````py
username = input("Enter username: ")

for i in username:
  print(i)

````

👉 Now type the code into `main.py` and test your prediction.

<details>
  <summary> 👀 Answer </summary>
  
This will display each character in a string called "username" as a separate output *(i.e. on a separate line).*

So the output will be: 

  ````
  N
  a
  m
  e
  ````
