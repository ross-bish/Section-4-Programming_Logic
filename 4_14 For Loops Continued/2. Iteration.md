# Iterations 📚

### Loop statements with `for` and strings.
- One useful aspect of a `for`loop is that it can be used to 
iterate through a string.

- This means, to go through the string, character by character *(item by item)*, performing the same 
set of instructions, one character at a time.

For example, type the following:
````py
inputText = "John28"
for character in inputText:
 print(character)
 
````

✍ Predict what the output will be.

🤔 Were you correct?

💡 *Note: that character is just a variable name. You can change this to any suitable variable name.*

## Task 2 👨‍💻

👉 Write a program that asks the user to enter a string of
any length. 

👉 Count the number of spaces in the string entered. Print the total number of spaces.

👉 Based on the number of spaces, print the word count 
for that sentence.

  Note that a basic word count is equal to the total number of spaces + 1.
