## Challenge 👨‍💻
Design a guessing game with the following parameters:

1. Your program generates a random number between 1-10 inclusive.

💡 Think back to the function we called before to generate a random number.

<details>
  <summary> Hint 👀 </summary>
  
````py
import random

random.randint()

````
</details>

2. Promt the user to enter their guess.
3. If they guess *too high*, display the following...
````
Too high, try again.
````
4. If they guess *too low*, display the following...
````
Too low, try again.
````
5. Keep prompting the user until they guess the correct number.

## Extra Credit ✨
👉 Can you edit your code so the user only has *3 attempts* to guess the correct number?
