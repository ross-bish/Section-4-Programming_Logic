# Make Task 👨‍💻

## User Login Challenge

Create a program that:

- Assigns the password ``abc123`` to a variable with a sensible identifier.
- Asks the user to input their "Username" and "password" and stores them in two new variables.
- Loops until the user enters the password ``abc123``.
- Outputs *"Login accepted"* when the user does enter ``abc123``.

## ✨Extra Credit
Add the following features...
- The username entered is displayed as part of the *'Login accepted'* message.
- The user gets an *'Error, incorrect password'* message if they get the password wrong.
- The program keeps count of how many tries the user takes to get the password right.
  - This number is output as part of the 'Login successful' message.
