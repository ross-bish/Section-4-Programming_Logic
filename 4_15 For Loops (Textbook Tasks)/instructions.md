# For Loops - Textbook Tasks 👨‍💻



💡*Note: Add comments where necessary to describe what your code is doing.*

## Task 1 
Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

## Task 2
Write a program that inputs a value from a user. The program counts from 1 to that value and prints 
out every *"odd number"*.

## Task 3
Create a program that counts and prints the number of vowels in a sentence.

## Task 4
Write a program that takes in a sentence and then reverses the sentence, using a `for` loop.

## Task 5
Write a program that takes in a sentence. Then ask the user to enter a single character *(a string of length 1)*. 

Next, using a `for` loop, count the occurrences of that character in the sentence.
