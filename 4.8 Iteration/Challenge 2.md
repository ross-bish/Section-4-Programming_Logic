# Challenge 2 - Guessing Game

Let‚Äôs say we wanted to enhance our "Guessing Game" program from last week to give the user only three guesses.

- We start off in the knowledge that our version of the program works properly.
- Our new upgrade can be achieved simply by *"wrapping"* the code inside a ``while loop`` that runs three times.

üëâ Code up your new version of the Guessing Game using a while loop in ``main.py``.

<details>
  <summary> Starter Code </summary>

  ````py
import random

number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(number) # have a sneak peek at number!

# Initialise a loop counter
counter = 0

# Loop 3 times
while counter 
  ````
</details>

## üí° Note:
The technique of wrapping code inside a loop is very important in the development of computer programs and systems.

Code wrapping is based on a notion that, if a piece of working code can be written using sequence/selection control structures only, then it should be relatively straightforward to put that code inside a loop!
